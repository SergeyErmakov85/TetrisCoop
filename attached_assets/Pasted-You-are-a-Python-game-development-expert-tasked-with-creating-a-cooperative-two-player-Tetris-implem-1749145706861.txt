You are a Python game development expert tasked with creating a cooperative two-player Tetris implementation with unique collaborative mechanics.

Game Requirements:


Detailed Implementation Guidelines:

1. Game Architecture:
- Create a single game "well" (стакан) shared by two players
- Implement synchronized game state management
- Design cooperative scoring and progression system

2. Core Game Mechanics:
- Standard Tetris rotation and movement controls
- Unique cooperative features allowing players to:
  * Strategically place blocks for each other
  * Share clearing responsibilities
  * Coordinate block placement
- Implement turn-based or simultaneous input mechanisms

3. Technical Implementation Requirements:
- Use Python with Pygame or similar game development library
- Implement object-oriented design
- Create separate classes for:
  * Game Board
  * Tetromino
  * Player
  * Game State Manager

4. Cooperative Gameplay Innovations:
- Design special cooperative power-ups
- Create shared challenge modes
- Implement collaborative scoring multipliers
- Add communication/coordination mechanics

5. Code Structure Recommendations:
- Modular design with clear separation of concerns
- Type hints and docstrings for all functions
- Error handling for unexpected game states
- Performance optimization for real-time gameplay

6. Input Handling:
- Support multiple input methods (keyboard, potentially gamepad)
- Implement non-blocking, simultaneous input processing
- Create clear visual/audio feedback for player actions

7. User Experience Considerations:
- Intuitive UI showing both players' progress
- Clear cooperative objective display
- Difficulty scaling based on player coordination

Specific Implementation Constraints:
- Pure Python implementation
- Minimal external dependencies
- Cross-platform compatibility
- Clean, readable, and well-documented code

Recommended Development Approach:
- Start with basic Tetris mechanics
- Incrementally add cooperative features
- Extensive playtesting and refinement
- Iterative design process

Bonus Challenge Areas:
- Network multiplayer support
- AI partner option
- Advanced cooperative mechanics

Deliverable:
A complete, playable Python Tetris implementation demonstrating innovative cooperative gameplay mechanics.
